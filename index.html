            Hi, I'm Brett Veldman.  I was born in Tampa, Florida on December 17, 1996.  I ended up moving to Colorado in 2008.  I currently live out in the Golden area with my family, who is made up of my mom, dad, younger brother, and dog.  I have some prior experience in computer science through college classes, though nothing too fancy.  I currently work at a Nissan dealership over near Golden.  Growing up, I've always had an interest in computers (both hardware and software), and have always desired a career relating to them in some way.  For fun, I enjoy hiking, drawing, playing video games, spending time with friends, and these days practicing code.  I also really love movies and tv, with my favorite ongoing show probably being Game of Thrones.  So far, I'm really enjoying this coding boot camp, and hope that I'll continue to enjoy learning even more.
